# Roboball-Detector
A deep learning model for detecting footballs in RoboSoccer environments using YOLOv8. Trained on a custom dataset with 80% training, 10% validation, and 10% testing split, leveraging data augmentation techniques like brightness and blur adjustments.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Custom YOLOv8 training with optimized epochs and anchor tuning
âœ… Robust dataset creation from RoboSoccer footage
âœ… Handles varying lighting and ball sizes for improved accuracy
âœ… Real-time detection tested on images and videos

ðŸ“Œ Key Learnings
Understanding model performance metrics (mAP, box loss, confidence levels)
Importance of dataset quality and augmentation for better generalization
Leveraging GPU acceleration for faster training
ðŸ”— Trained model hosted on Roboflow | Built using Google Colab + Ultralytics YOLOv8
